    <h3>
      Pre-lab exercise: Completing the <code>FunnyFace</code> class
    </h3>

    <p>
      You are given the Java files for the <code>Face</code> interface and the
      <code>FunnyFace</code> class that implements the <code>Face</code>
      interface. The class, as given, is not fully implemented; you will be
      completing the class implementation in this lab. Before starting the lab,
      compile and run the <code>FaceTest</code> program to see how the face
      works.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that there are several methods in the <code>Face</code> interface
      that are stubs in the <code>FunnyFace</code> class. A <code>stub</code> is
      a method that exists, but does nothing. The test program actually calls
      the stub methods, but you don't see them working because they don't change
      the appearance of the face. In this lab, you will modify the
      <code>FunnyFace</code> class so that it implements the stub methods.
    </p>

    <p>
      The methods that you have to implement all change the appearance of the
      face in some way. As the programmer, you can modify the appearance of an
      object by moving it, resizing it, or replacing it with a different shape.
      Moving the eyes or the mouth will probably not give the appearance of
      closing or smiling or frowning, so let's leave that option aside. (Moving
      the eyes up could be used to express surprise, but that's not what you're
      working on today.)
    </p>

    <p>
      The easier process is to re-size an object. Consider closing the eyes:
      they need to change from (relatively) large ovals to something the same
      width, but not very tall. Ideally, closed eyes would look like a downward
      curve, but that shape isn't available to us. One the other hand, if you
      change the dimensions of the eye so that it's a wide short oval, it will
      probably look enough like a closed eye for our purposes. You can change
      its shape with the <code>scale(sx, sy)</code> method, using 1.0 for
      <code>sx</code> to keep the width the same and maybe 0.2 for
      <code>sy</code> to make it one-fifth its former height. You can then scale
      it back to open the eyes using the inverse scale factors. You'll probably
      need to move the eyes down when you close them and back up when you open
      them. Try this out before you go on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Making the mouth smile or frown is not so simple, because the mouth must
      actually change shape. The general process for changing a shape is first
      to remove the object (<code>this.remove(mouth);</code> in this case), then
      to create the new shape and assign it to the appropriate variable, and
      finally to add the new shape. The best shape for a smiling or frowning
      mouth is probably a <code>GArc</code>. Look in the documentation for this
      shape. The first constructor listed in the documentation allows you to
      specify the width and height of its bounding rectangle, and the angles
      that control the curve of the arc. The first two parameters should
      probably be the same as for the neutral mouth (oval). The <em>start</em>
      angle for the frown will be a somewhere around 0&deg; and the
      <em>sweep</em> angle should be 180&deg; minus twice the <em>start</em>
      angle. For example, if the start angle is -25&deg;, then the sweep angle
      should be 130&deg;, unless you want a crooked frown. Try this out, and
      experiment with the parameters until you get the smile and frown you want.
      If you want to get fancy, you can overlay the first arc with a second arc
      in the face fill color to get a crescent shape. You should add the new
      mouth at the same location that the original mouth was added.
