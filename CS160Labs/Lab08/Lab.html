      Lab 8: Making Funny Faces
    </h2>

    <h3>
      Part1: Implementing the <code>OddFace</code> class
    </h3>

    <p>
      Using <code>FunnyFace</code> as a template, complete the implementation of
      the <code>OddFace</code> class. In this class, use some color and filled
      shapes, use a polygon for the outline of the face, and make sure that
      overall face is distinct from the other. Modify the test program so that
      one of the two faces is an <code>OddFace</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Part 2: and another sort of face
    </h3>

    <p>
      Make a third distinct face class. Make a new user program that displays
      three faces of the three different types and runs a simple animation,
      i.e., at most one click to get the program started, that shows their
      various changes of expression.
