    <h2>
      Stacks and queues&#8212;matching parens and waiting clients
    </h2>

    <p>
      In this lab, you will write two programs, one that matches parentheses
      using a stack and one that manages a queue of waiting clients.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Preliminaries
    </h3>

    <p>
      Using a terminal window, copy the directory named <kbd>Lab16</kbd> from
      <kbd>/usr/people/classes/CS160/labs</kbd> into your <kbd>CS160</kbd>
      directory. Use the <kbd>tree</kbd> command to verify that the directory
      structure for your local copy of <kbd>Lab16</kbd> matches the following:

    <h3>
      Part 1: Matching parentheses
    </h3>

    <p>
      In this part you will create a program called
      <code>MatchParentheses</code>, that reads a text file (probably a computer
      code file) and determines whether the parentheses (&#8216;{&#8217;,
      &#8216;}&#8217;; &#8216;(&#8217;, &#8216;)&#8217;; &#8216;[&#8217;,
      &#8216;]&#8217;) match properly. There are three ways parentheses can fail
      to match:
      <ol>
        <li>
          there can be right parentheses with no matched left parentheses
        </li>
        <li>
          there can be an improper match, such as &#8216;(&#8217; with
          &#8216;}&#8217;
        </li>
        <li>
          there can be left parentheses with no matched right parentheses
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      Using the original <code>RemoveWhitespace</code> program as a template,
      create the new program, first changing the name of the class to
      <code>MatchParentheses</code>. Add an instance variable of type
      <code>Stack</code>, and initialize it in the <em>constructor</em> method.
      You can find the documentation for the <code>Stack</code> class in the
      JavaDocs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Remove the <code>print()</code> and <code>println()</code> statements from
      the program. Next, replace the <code>if</code> statement in the
      <code>run()</code> method with a new <code>if</code> (or
      <code>switch</code>) statement that works as follows:
      <ol>
        <li>
          if <code>c</code> is a left paren, push it onto the stack
          (<code>stack.push(c)</code>)
        </li>
        <li>
          if <code>c</code> is a right paren, first determine if the stack is
          empty; if so, print an error message that there is an unmatched right
          parenthesis, close <code>scanner</code> and return; otherwise, compare
          <code>c</code> to the character on the top of the stack using
          <code>stack.peek()</code>; if the parentheses types match, pop the
          left paren from the stack (<code>stack.pop()</code>); if the
          parentheses types don't match, print an error message that there is a
          mismatch (including the mismatched parens and the line number), close
          <code>scanner</code> and return
        </li>
        <li>
          for any other kind of character there is nothing to do
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      When (and if) the program exits the <code>while</code>-loop, check to see
      if the stack is empty. If so, print a message that all the parentheses
      match; otherwise, print an error message that there is an unmatched left
      parenthesis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Test your program on the included test files and on one of your finished
      Java files. The Java file will probably have no errors. Why? Can you think
      a situation where a Java program could compile without errors but still
      not pass your program's test? Show your completed program to the TA or lab
      instructor before you continue.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Part 2: Managing a queue of clients
    </h3>
   
    <p> 
      Look at the <code>LabelSample</code> program in your directory. Run the
      program and be sure you understand how it works. You may use this as a
      model for creating the <code>Queue</code> program as described below.
    </p>

    <p>
      Write a <code>GraphicsProgram</code> that manages a queue of clients for a
      business. The program will have two operations: a new client can be added
      to the queue and a client can be served from the queue. The program will
      have two &#8220;buttons&#8221; for the two operations and will display
      those waiting in the queue graphically.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>init()</code> method does several things: It sets up the canvas
      with two <code>GRoundRect</code> objects one on the left and one on the
      right with space in the middle to display the queue. Each rectangle has a
      <code>GLabel</code> on it, one saying &#8220;Add Client&#8221; and the
      other saying &#8220;Serve Client&#8221;. Color the rectangles and labels
      so that the rectangles contrast with the background, but the labels are
      clearly readable. Each of the <code>GRoundRect</code>s should have its own
      instance variable. There should also be an instance variable for the queue
      of type <code>Queue</code>, which is initialized to be a new
      <code>LinkedList</code>. Declare appropriate static constants for the
      positions and spacing of all graphical objects.
    </p>

    <p>
      The action takes place in the <code>mouseClicked()</code> method. If the
      click is contained in the &#8220;Add Client&#8221; rectangle, the method
      calls the <code>addClient()</code> method; if the click is contained in
      the &#8220;Serve Client&#8221; rectangle, the method calls the
      <code>serveClient()</code> method; otherwise, it does nothing.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>addClient()</code> method gets the name of the new client from
      the user. It creates a new <code>GLabel</code> from the name located at
      the bottom of the queue display (top center for the first element),
      enqueues the label and adds it to the canvas. To know where to put the
      label, the program will need to keep track of the size of the queue since
      the <code>Queue</code> class doesn't have a size method; so you'll also
      need an instance variable for this value, and you should increment it
      here.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>serveClient()</code> method first checks to see if the queue is
      empty; if so, it prints a message stating there is no one to serve. If the
      queue is not empty, it dequeues the first label from the queue, removes it
      from the canvas, moves the remaining queue elements up on the canvas using
      the iterator and prints a message stating which client has been served.
    </p>

    <p>
      Test your program thoroughly and then show it to the TA or lab instructor.
