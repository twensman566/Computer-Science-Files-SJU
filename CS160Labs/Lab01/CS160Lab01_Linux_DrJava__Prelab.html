<h1>CSCI 160&#8212;Object-Oriented Programming and Problem-Solving</h1>
<h2>Lab 1: Using the Linux Desktop and DrJava&#8212;Pre-lab</h2>

This pre-lab exercise is a tutorial on using Linux and the DrJava program.
You need to complete it at a Linux machine, following and trying the instructions.
You will be asked to show the TA or lab instructor the work you did in this
tutorial at the beginning of Lab 1.

<h3>Part 1: The Linux desktop</h3>

<p>
The screen setup you have on the Linux workstation is called <i>Gnome</i>.
<i>Gnome</i> is similar to other Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) like Windows.
The main <i>Gnome</i> menu can be accessed by clicking the left-most icon on the
menu bar at the top (or bottom) of the screen,
a gray footprint followed by the word &#8220;Applications&#8221;.
This is like the start button in Windows and it has many sub-menus allowing the
user to configure the system as well as run various applications.
You can get to most of the applications that will be used in this course
by going to the <em>CSBSJU&#8594;Computer Science</em> choice on the main menu.</p>

<br>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img style="width: 555px; height: 323px;" alt="menu" src="Images/CS160_Linux_DrJava_ApplicationMenu.jpg">
</div>

<br>
<p>
In the <i>CSBSJU</i> sub-menu you will see, among other things, option for changing
your password, opening internet applications (including <em>Chromium</em>,
<em>Firefox</em> and <i>Skype</i>),
and a full office suite (called <em>LibreOffice</em>) that's similar to
<em>MicroSoft Office</em>.
Next note that if you choose <em>Computer Science</em> from the <em>CSBSJU</em> sub-menu,
another list of applications appears, including the <i>DrJava</i> application you wil be
using this term.</p>

<p>
There are several other buttons and icons on the menu bar possibly including
a web browser, a clock, and your user ID.
The green running-person icon is for logging off or logging in a different user.
A task bar at the bottom of the screen currently holds
boxes with labeled icons for any applications running
in the current desktop (lower left), a trash bucket and 
boxes for multiple Desktop indicators (lower right corner).
On the desktop (large window), you can see several other icons,
including a trash bucket, a link to your home directory,
a link to the computer's file system and possibly a few others.</p>


<h4>The terminal window</h4>

<p>Much of your work will be done using a terminal window.
This is a window from which you can issue commands to
the Linux operating system.
The window may have automatically appeared when you logged in.
If not, you can create a new terminal window by selecting
<em>Terminal</em> from the <em>System Tools</em> sub-menu of the
<em>Applications</em>-menu or by clicking the Terminal icon on the tools bar
(the gray screen with a &#8220;&gt;_&#8221; in it).</p>

<p>
The terminal window has a prompt, which generally ends in a percent sign (%)
or a dollar sign ($) followed by a cursor, which is a solid black box
the size of one character when the window is active or an outline box
when the window is not active.
When the cursor follows the prompt in a terminal window, you can type
commands to the operating system, and they will appear at the cursor position.
However, the command you type will not work until you press the Enter key,
at which time the computer will execute your command.</p>

<p>
Go to the terminal window and type <kbd>ls</kbd>
(the <em>letters</em> &#8216;l&#8217; and &#8216;s&#8217;),
followed by the Enter key.
This command tells Linux to show a <em>l</em>i<em>s</em>t of the files
in the current working directory.
(Note that Linux is case sensitive; you must use the correct case&#8212;usually
lower&#8212;in all Linux commands.)
In this case, you will probably see something like the following:</p>

<p>
<kbd>
[jdoe@lin3 1 ~]$ ls<br>
Desktop&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Templates<br>
Documents&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pictures&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Videos<br>
Downloads&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public<br>
[jdoe@lin3 2 ~]$</kbd> </p>

<p>
Your prompt and file list will probably be different the what is illustrated here.
Try to account for why your prompt looks as it does before you go on.</p>


<h4>Directories</h4>

<p>
Like most modern operating systems,
Linux systems arrange files hierarchically using directories.
A <em>directory</em> is a type of file that conceptually contains files,
and since directories are themselves files,
directories can contain directory files as well.
Directories are also called <i>folders</i> after
the common icon used to represent them.
</p>

<p>
In order to access a file, you need to know what directory it's in,
and since a directory is also a file, you need to know which directory 
contains the directory, and so on.
Fortunately, there is one directory not contained in any other directory
called the <em>root</em> directory, but named &#8220;/&#8221;.
Files in the root directory can be accessed by a name starting with the
slash character followed by file name.
For example, there is a directory in the root directory named &#8220;usr&#8221;;
it can be accessed by the name &#8220;/usr&#8221;.
Files in other directories can be named by following the name of the containing
directory with another slash and then the file name.
Consider the following directory name:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>/usr/people/faculty/cs/foobar/CS160</kbd></p>

<p>
This long name refers to a file or directory named &#8220;CS160&#8221; in a
directory named &#8220;foobar&#8221; in a directory named &#8220;cs&#8221; in a
directory named &#8220;faculty&#8221; in a directory named &#8220;people&#8221;
in a directory named &#8220;usr&#8221; in the root directory. Such a directory
name, starting with the slash character, is refered to as the <i>fully qualified
  domain name</i> or <i>absolute path</i> of a file; The sequence of directories
and sub-directories from the root directory to the desired file is called the
<i>path</i>. Any file in the Linux file system can be named in this way. Note
that Linux and other flavors of Unix use the <em>slash</em> character
(&#8216;/&#8217;) to separate directories in a file name; Microsoft Windows uses
the <em>backslash</em> character (&#8216;\&#8217;) instead. URLs for the
Internet also use the slash character. Be careful to distinguish the two
characters; you will often hear people use the wrong character name. Note also,
that Unix has no concept of separate drive (A:, C:, M:, etc.) as in Windows,
although the Unix file system is typically spread over multiple devices; it's
just that all that is usually transparent to the user.</p>

<p>
Every directory automatically contains two special directories.
You generally won&#8217;t see these, but they are sometimes useful.
You can see them if you type <kbd>ls -a</kbd> (<i>list all</i>)
at a terminal prompt.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
      A directory named &#8220;.&#8221; (i.e., a single period character) that
      refers to the containing directory containing itself.
      It's a convenient way to name the current directory without specifying
      the full path name.
  </li>
  <li>
      A directory named &#8220;..&#8221; (i.e., two periods together)
      refers to the parent directory of the containing directory.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
There may be other files and directories with names beginning with the period
character in a directory.
Collectively, these files are referred to as hidden files, because they're
usually invisible;
this is the difference between the plain <kbd>ls</kbd> command and the
<kbd>ls -a</kbd> command;
the first doesn't show the hidden files;
the latter does.</p>

<p>
Another useful directory shortcut to know about is the &#8220;~&#8221;
symbol, which is shorthand for a home directory.
(&#8216;~&#8221; is the <em>tilde</em> character, 
which is pronounced <em>till-dee</em>;
it is usually found at the upper left corner of the keyboard.)
Used alone, the tilde character is shorthand for the user's home directory
path;
used with another user's ID (e.g. ~jqpublic), it is shorthand for the
home directory of that user.
For example, if a user named <em>jqpublic</em> has a home directory with
the path <kbd>/usr/people/home/jqpublic</kbd>, we can refer to the user's
<i>www-docs</i> file by the name &#8220;~jqpublic/www-docs&#8221;.</p>

<p>
There's also the concept of the <em>current working directory</em>;
when you name a file without an initial slash or tilde character, the
computer (usually) computes the path relative to the current working
directory.
You can see the current working directory with the <kbd>pwd</kbd> command;
when you first open a terminal, the current working directory is your
home directory.
You can change the current working directory with the <kbd>cd</kbd> command;
we'll explore that further below.
Suppose the current directory is <kbd>/usr/people/home/jqpublic</kbd>
and that directory contains a file named <em>foobar</em>;
we can refer to the file by its fully qualified domain name
<kbd>/usr/people/home/jqpublic/foobar</kbd>;
we can refer to it directly as <kbd>foobar</kbd> since it's in the
current working directory; or, assuming <i>jqpublic</i> is a user,
we can refer to it as <kbd>~jqpublic/foobar</kbd>.
Similarly, we can refer to the parent directory of the current directory
<kbd>/usr/people/home</kbd> as &#8220;..&#8221;,
and if that directory contains a directory named <em>qjprivate</em>,
we can refer to it as <kbd>../qjprivate</kbd> rather than typing
<kbd>/usr/people/home/qjprivate</kbd>.</p>


<h4>Desktop file access</h4>

<p>
Your home directory is represented on the desktop by an icon of a folder
and the image of a house with your user name under it.
Double-click it now to open a graphical
window displaying the contents of your home directory.
As with Windows and MacOS computers, you can use a graphical interface
to view your file structure, but you can also view it using
a terminal window and command line statements.
(Did you even know you could do that with PCs and Macs?)</p>

<p>
For the sake of organization, let's create a folder in your home directory
called &#8220;CS160&#8221; to store all work related to this course.
We'll do this using a terminal and the command line.
First, verify that you still have a terminal window open;
if not, open a new one.
On the command line, type <kbd>pwd</kbd> (for <em>p</em>rint
<em>w</em>orking <em>d</em>irectory,
and verify that the current working directory is your home directory.
If you're not sure whether this is your home directory, type the command:</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>cd</kbd>

<p>
and then repeat the <kbd>pwd</kbd> command.
The <kbd>cd</kbd> command with no other arguments always returns you to
your home directory, so you can use it as a homing command.
If you haven't already done so, type the <kbd>ls</kbd> command to see what files
you currently have.</p>

<p>
Next type the following with <i>exactly</i> the same capitalization:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>mkdir CS160</kbd></p>

<p>
After entering this command, list your files again to to see
what this command does.
<kbd>mkdir</kbd> stands for <em>m</em>a<em>k</em>e <em>dir</em>ectory,
so it should have added a new directory named <em>CS160</em>.
Use this directory from now on to put files for this course.</p>

<p>
In the file window displaying the contents of your home directory you
should now see an additional icon for the directory you just created.
(You may need to re-load the window first; use either the circular arrows
on the tool bar or the <em>Reload</em> option in the <em>View</em> menu.)
Double-click the the new folder's icon to show its contents,
which should be empty at this point.</p>

<p>
Now you need to copy the files needed for the rest of today's lab into
your <em>CS160</em> directory.
To do this, go back to the terminal window and enter the command
<kbd>cd&nbsp;CS160</kbd>.
(<kbd>cd</kbd> stands for <em>c</em>hange <em>d</em>irectory.)
Now use the <kbd>pwd</kbd> command to verify that the current
working directory is <em>~/CS160</em>.
If not, make sure you're in your home directory (using the <kbd>cd</kbd>
and <kbd>pwd</kbd> commands) and then try the <kbd>cd&nbsp;CS160</kbd> again.
If you're still not in the right place, check the spelling on the
directory name, to be sure you've spelled it the same with the same
upper-case letters.</p>

<p>
Once you are ready, type the following, <em>exactly</em> as written,
or copy it from here and paste it into the terminal window,
being sure to include the final space and period characters:
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>cp -R
/usr/people/classes/CS160/labs/Lab01 .</kbd><br>
</p>

<p>
<kbd>cp</kbd> stands for <em>c</em>o<em>p</em>y, which will
copy the specified directory <em>Lab01</em>, stored in
<kbd>/usr/people/classes/CS160/labs</kbd>
into the directory <em>~/CS160</em> that you created above.
The <kbd>-R</kbd> option tells Linux to copy the contents of the directory
along with all its sub-directories.
In this case, <em>~/CS160</em> is the current working directory, so we
use the &#8220;.&#8221; name for it.</p>

<p>
Use the command <kbd>ls&nbsp;Lab01</kbd> to verify that there
is now a <em>Mammals</em> directory along with two Java files and a class file
in the <em>Lab01</em> directory.
(This assumes CS160 is still your current working directory.)
Next use the command <kbd>ls&nbsp;Lab01/Mammals</kbd>
to see what's in the <em>Mammals</em> sub-directory;
you should see three sub-directories with appropriate names there.</p>

<p>
Again, you should keep all your computer files for this
course in your <em>CS160</em> directory;
keep separate directories inside this directory for each lab.
As you use computers more and more you will find that organizing
your files into well-named directories is extremely useful.
It makes it much easier to find your files.
For each of the coming labs, you will be copying or creating
a directory for that lab
and keeping the additional files you create for that lab there.
You will create additional directories for programming projects outside
the labs.</p>

<p>
You can also use the file window to manage your files and directories.
The process is essentially the same as with Windows or MacOS.
You can practice this on your own, if you wish.
It's important, however, to learn to use the Linux command line interface,
so most lab instructions will be given for the command line.</p>


<h4>Creating, saving and deleting files</h4>

<p>
In your previous computing work, you have learned to create, save and
delete files using several different applications.
The process in Linux is pretty much the same as in Windows or MacOS, but
the applications are a little different.
Most of our work in this course will be working with Java program files,
and we'll use an application called <em>DrJava</em> most of the time.
DrJava contains a text editor that can be used to manage both Java
program files and ordinary text files.
If you want to use a stand-alone text editor, we recommend <em>gedit</em>,
which you can find in the <em>Applications&#8594;CSBSJU&#8594;Text Editors</em>
menu.
For word-processing and spreadsheets, it's probably best to use Microsoft Office
via Citrix, which is discussed briefly at the end of this tutorial.</p>


<h3>Part 2: DrJava</h3>

<p>
<em>DrJava</em> is an easy to use software development
environment for writing Java programs.
It was created by members of the Computer Science Department
at Rice University, and is currently under active
development by the <em>JavaPLT</em> group at Rice.
DrJava is designed primarily for student use and provides an interactive facility
for developing Java code.
It includes an editor and debugger, and it
incorporates the <em>JUnit</em> testing framework and
the <em>javadoc</em> documentation generating tool.</p>
<p>
You can download DrJava for use on your home or dorm room system from
<a href="http://drjava.sourceforge.net/">http://drjava.sourceforge.net/</a>.</p>

<p>
Start DrJava by choosing <em>CSBSJU&#8594;Computer Science&#8594;DrJava</em> from
the Applications menu.
DrJava's main window is divided into three panels:
The largest area to the right is the definitions pane;
you write and edit Java programs in the definitions pane.
The narrower panel on the left is the open document list;
it displays a list of open documents.
You can view and edit a particular document by selecting it from the list;
when you click on a document in the list,
it will be displayed in the definitions pane.
The bottom panel contains several tabbed panes;
clicking the tab displays the corresponding pane.
For the present, we will be concerned with the interactions pane
and the compiler output pane.
You can enter and evaluate java statements and expressions
in the interactions pane;
compilation results are displayed in the compiler output pane.</p>


<h4>Configuring DrJava</h4>

<p>
DrJava should be configured correctly for you automatically, but it's
a good idea to check its options before you go on.
If the options aren't set correctly, you can have serious problems with
compiling your programs.
The following steps will insure that DrJava is configured correctly for you.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Choose the <em>Preferences</em> option from the <em>Edit</em> pull-down menu;
     this action will bring up the <em>Preferences</em> window.</li>
  <li>If it is not already chosen, select the <em>Resource Locations</em> item
     in the <em>Categories</em> pane on the left.
     This item allows us to identify resources that DrJava needs
     to compile and run our programs.</li>
  <li>Check the text box associated with <em>Tools.jar Location</em>, which
     is used to let DrJava know where to find the Java program.
     Verify that it contains a string beginning with <kbd>/opt/jdk-1.8</kbd>
     and ending with <kbd>/lib/tools.jar</kbd>.
     If not, erase the contents of the text box and enter the string
     <kbd>/opt/java-jdk/lib/tools.jar</kbd>, which will resolve to the correct
     path.</li>
  <li>Next, check the text area associated with <em>Extra Classpath</em>.
     It should contain several directory paths;
     be sure that it contains the following four,
     not necessarily in that order:
     <ul><kbd>
        </kbd><li>/usr/people/classes/Java</li>
        <li>/usr/people/classes/Java/acm</li>
      <li>/usr/people/classes/Java/Javabook/<br>
      </li>
<li>&lt;<em>your home directory path</em>&gt;/JavaPackages</li>
     </ul>
     If any of those paths is missing, use the <em>Add</em> button to add them
     or ask the instructor or TA for help at the beginning of lab.
     If there are other paths there, leave them alone.</li>

  <li>If you made any changes in the previous two steps,
     click the <em>Apply</em> button to effect the changes.</li>
  <li>Select the category <em>Miscellaneous</em>.
     Verify that the item <em>Automatically Close Block Comments</em> is checked.
     If not, click its check box and then click <em>Apply</em>.</li>
  <li>Select the category <em>Display Options</em>.
     Note that there is a check box labeled <em>Show All Line Numbers</em>.
     If this box is checked, any document displayed in the definitions pane
     will be shown with numbered lines, which is useful for finding errors;
     if it is not checked, check it and click <em>Apply</em>.</li>
  <li>If you wish, click each of the remaining categories
     to get an idea of the options that can be set.</li>
  <li>Dismiss the Preferences window by clicking <em>OK</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You don't need to set the options every time you run DrJava.
Once you set them, DrJava will remember them the next time you run
the application.</p>


<h4>The Definitions Pane</h4>

<p>
Click <em>Open</em> on the DrJava tool bar, and navigate to your
<em>Lab01</em> sub-directory.
There should be a file namded <em>TouchyWindow.java</em> in this directory.
Select this file and open it.
The contents of the file will appear in the definitions pane.</p>

<p>
There are several things you should notice about this program.
First, the text is displayed in several different colors.
Each color denotes a different kind of <i>lexical component</i>.
For instance, words like <kbd>public</kbd> and <kbd>class</kbd>
are keywords, which are special words that are predefined in a 
programming language; 
DrJava displays all keywords in a unique color.
Text in quotes is shown in a different color
and numeric values in yet another color.
The color coding can help you recognize keying mistakes when you
create a program of your own.</p>

<p>
Second, the text is indented in a uniform way.
This indenting reflects the
structure of the program and makes it easier to read.
When you key in a program, DrJava automatically indents for you.
If the indenting is not what you expect,
it is often a sign that you have made a syntactic mistake.
Try the following to see how DrJava helps you with indenting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click at the beginning of the line that begins
     <kbd>public void init</kbd> and enter a few spaces
     by pressing on the space bar on your keyboard.
     Do the same with the next couple of lines.</li>
  <li>Select those lines by dragging the mouse across them
     so they're highlighted.</li>
  <li>Press the <em>Tab</em> key.
     Notice that the original indenting is restored and is once
     again correct according to Java style standards.
     (Unlike Python, indenting has no programmatic meaning in Java.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
In DrJava, you can use the <em>Tab</em> key to correct the indenting
of the current line or of a group of selected lines.
This behavior is unlike most text editors, which insert a <em>Tab</em>
character if you press the <em>Tab</em> key.
You should also take care not to rely too much on DrJava's indenting
prowess;
if there are syntax errors in the program, DrJava may not be able to
indent it correctly, although that in itself is a good indication that
a syntax error is present, usually a mismatched parenthesis or brace.</p>

<p>
Third, DrJava will show matching parentheses, braces, and brackets
by highlighting the text they enclose.</p>

<ul>
   <li>Find the line that begins <kbd>public void mousePressed</kbd>
      and select the following left parenthesis or click just after it.
      Notice that the entire string <kbd>(MouseEvent e)</kbd></li>
   <li>Find the line that begins <kbd>public void mousePressed</kbd>
      and select the following left parenthesis or click just after it.
      Notice that the entire string <kbd>(MouseEvent e)</kbd> becomes
      highlighted, indicating a pair of matching parentheses.</li>
   <li>Try again by selecting or clicking after the right parenthesis;
      you should get the same result.</li>
   <li>Now select or click after the left curly brace at the end of the line;
      it will show you the corresponding matching right curly brace
      two lines below.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is another feature that can help you find and avoid
mistakes when you key a program.</p>


<h4>Navigating</h4>

<p>
Notice that each line in the display pane is now numbered,
since we set this option earlier.
Error messages often mention a line number.
You can navigate to line by number by choosing the <em>Go To Line</em>&#8230;
option from the <em>Edit</em> menu, or by keying <kbd>Ctrl-G</kbd>.
(That is, hold the <em>Control</em> or <em>Ctrl</em> key down and key
the <em>G</em> key.)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Type <kbd>Ctrl-G</kbd>, enter <em>10</em> in the field labeled
     <em>What line would you like to go to?</em> and click <em>OK</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Your cursor should now be at the start of line 10 in the definitions pane.</p>

<p>
You can also navigate to a specific string in the definitions pane by choosing
<em>Find/Replace</em> from the <em>Edit</em> menu
or by keying <kbd>Ctrl-F</kbd>.
This action opens the <em>Find/Replace</em> tab in the bottom panel, which has
a <em>Find Next</em> text area, a <em>Replace With</em> text area, several
check boxes for controlling its behavior and buttons for its actions.
It's an enhanced version of the find and replace function available in most
text editors and word processors and in many other applications.
The usual keyboard short-cuts also work for copy, cut and paste.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open the <em>Find/Replace</em> tab by one of the methods above.</li>
  <li>Key <kbd>public</kbd> into the <em>Find Next</em> text area,
     and try the various find buttons to see all the places this string
     occurs in the program.</li>
  <li>Click the <em>X</em>-button in the upper-right corner of the pane created
     by the <em>Find All</em> operation to close it;
     you can close other tabs in the bottom panel the same way.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Compiling a program</h4>

<p>You will notice that the document name <em>TouchyWindow.java</em> is
followed by an asterisk (*) in the open document list.
(You may need to scroll the window or make it wider to see the asterisk.)
This symbol means that the document has been modified in
the definitions pane but the changes have not been saved to disk.
(You modified the document when you added and removed the spaces.)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click the <em>Save</em> button on the tool bar to write the changes to disk.
     You can also save by choosing <em>Save</em> from the <em>File</em> menu;
     the <em>Save As</em> choice allows you to save a copy under a different name.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Next, you will compile the class definition; that is, you will invoke
a program called a compiler that will translate the Java text program into
machine level code that can be interpreted by the Java interpreter.
(The interpreter is called the <em>Java Virtual Machine</em> or <em>JVM</em>.)
If successful, the compilation process will produce
a new file named the same as the Java file but with the extension
<em>.class</em>, saved in the current working directory.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click the <em>Compile</em> button on the tool bar.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Something is wrong.
Notice that the <em>Compiler Output</em> tabbed pane
at the bottom of the window is selected, and it indicates that several errors
have been found.
The first error is highlighted along with the line in the definitions pane
that caused the error.</p>

<p>
Let's look carefully at the first error.
The error message is at the end of the highlighted part of the 
<em>Compiler Output</em> pane;
it states &#8220;class, interface, or enum expected.&#8221;
That's a pretty cryptic message, and it doesn't really tell you much about
what's wrong.
(More often, the actual error message states the problem quite clearly.)
In this case the problem is pretty obvious;
the word &#8220;import&#8221; is misspelled.
Let's correct this problem before going on to the remaining errors.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Correct the spelling error in Line 4.</li>
  <li>Click the <em>Compile</em> button again;
     (DrJava saves the file automatically when you compile it).</li>
</ul>

<p>
The first error should be gone now, and you'll see two errors in Line
33, followed by two in Line 34;
notice also that the indenting appears odd in Lines 34 and 34;
(at least they do for the lab writer).
It's almost always best to work errors from first to last, because
later errors may turn out not to be errors at all, but just fall-out
from an earlier error.
Let's see if that's the case here.
The first error message says &#8220;unclosed string literal&#8221;,
which is a very helpful error message if you know a little Java.
Now compare Line 33 that has the error with Line 30 that doesn't have
an error.
Both lines have very similar syntax, but they're colored differently.
How can you account for the difference?
In Line 30, the text &#8220;Click in this window&#8221; is enclosed
in straight double-quote characters (not in left and right double
quotes as in this write-up);
in Line 33, the second quote character is not there.
That's what the error message means:
text enclosed in double-quote character is called a <em>string literal</em>
in Java;
the first quote mark opens the literal and the second closes it.
We need to add that second quote mark.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add a double-quote character between the &#8216;!&#8217;
     and the &#8216;,&#8217; in Line 33.
     Notice how the color changes and now matches Line 30.</li>
  <li>Click the <em>Compile</em> button again.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now you should still see several errors, but they are different errors
that before.
This is progress, even if it doesn't seems like it.</p>

<p>
One by one we need to correct the errors in the file.
The remaining errors in this program should all be
fairly easy to figure out,
even without much knowledge of Java.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find and correct each of the errors in the file.
     Keep a separate note of each error as you find it to show
     when you submit the pre-lab.
     You should click on the compile button after
     correcting each error to see if it eliminates other errors
     that were listed as well.</li>
  <li>Once you have all of the errors corrected, you should
     be able to click on the compile all button and get a message in the
     Compiler Output pane at the bottom of the screen something like:
     &#8220;Last compilation completed successfully&amp;#rdquo;.
     Copy that message into your lab notes.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Running a program from DrJava</h4>

<p>
Java programs are classes that contain a method declared as
<kbd>public static void main</kbd>, which you can see in Line 54
of the <em>TouchyWindow</em> program.
In DrJava, we can run programs with this method by clicking the
<em>Run</em> button on the DrJava toolbar.
If the program has compiled successfully, the program will now
run, although it may or may not run correctly.
Programs that don't run correctly is a problem we'll save for another
lab!</p>

<ul>
  <li>If your program compiles successfully, click the <em>Run</em>
     button on the DrJava toolbar.
     Doing this should cause the <em>Interactions</em> pane to appear
     with the command &#8220;run TouchyWindow&#8220;, and it should
     launch a new window containing the text
     &#8220;Click in this window&#8221;.</li>
  <li>Play with the program by following the onscreen directions.
     Try pressing and releasing the mouse slow in separate action
     and in different places.
     Look over the Java program code and see if you can begin to
     understand how this program causes the behavior you see in the
     window.</li>
  <li>When you are finished with the program, close the window by
     clicking the close-box or selecting <em>Quit</em> from the
     <em>File</em>menu.
     Note that doing this causes a message box to appear in the DrJava
     window and resets the <em>Interactions</em> pane.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Be prepared to show the instructor or TA the folders you created
in this tutorial along with your working <em>TouchyWindow</em> program
at the beginning of the lab session.
If you're having trouble with this exercise and need help
completing it, there
are TAs available every evening except Friday and Saturday in Peter
Engel Room 212 (this lab) and in the Clemens Library at St Ben's.
