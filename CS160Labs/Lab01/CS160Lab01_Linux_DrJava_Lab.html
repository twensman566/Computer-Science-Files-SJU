<h1>CSCI 160&mdash;Object-Oriented Programming and Problem-Solving</h1>
<h2>Lab 1: Using the Linux Desktop and DrJava</h2>


<h3>Part 1: Managing files from the Linux command line</h3>

<p>
In this part, you will be creating new files and directories and adding them to the
Mammals file hierarchy in your Lab01 directory.
Here is a drawing of the directory hierarchy you will be starting with:</p>

</p>

<p>
To start, make sure that you have a terminal window open.
Everything you do in this section will be done from that window.
You should also open a new text file in a text editor&mdash;you
can choose <em>New</em> from the File menu in DrJava
or open a new file in gedit.
Save the file now (and often as you work) as
&ldquo;&lt;your&nbsp;last&nbsp;name&gt;&lt;your&nbsp;first&nbsp;name&gt;Lab01Report.txt&rdquo;.
(For example, Juanita Doe would name the file &ldquo;DoeJuanitaLab01Report.txt&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
For your reference, the table below summarizes all the
Linux commands we will use in this lab assignment.
Don't try to execute any of the example instructions in the figure as
some are irreversible and may mess up your files;
just look through them before continuing.
Refer back to the pre-lab write-up for detailed information
on the Linux commands you need to complete this exercise.</p>

</p>

<p>
Complete each of the following exercises using the terminal window.
As you complete each exercises, copy the contents of the terminal window for
that part into your lab report file.
You might use directory windows to help visualize the effects of your commands.
In order to see the changes, however, you may need to
click the refresh button (circular arrows) after doing the command.
Again, you should be using the command line for all actions.</p>

<p>
If at any time you do not see the files and directories you expected to see,
stop and figure out where you have gone wrong&mdash;it could be you've entered
the wrong commands, or it could just as well be that your expectations were off.
As you complete each command, you need to understand what it does.
If you need help, remember to ask a TA or a professor.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start by using the <em>pwd</em> command to make sure you are in the
     <em>Lab01</em> directory.
     If you are not in this directory,
     get there by using the <em>cd</em> command.
     You can get there with one command if you recognize that
     &ldquo;~/CS160/Lab01&rdquo; is one of the names
     of the directory.</li><br>
  <li>Use <em>ls</em> to see what files and directories are in the directory.
     Next use the <em>tree</em> command to see the subdirectory structure.
     Compare the resulting diagram to the structure of the
     <em>Mammals</em> hierarchy above.</li><br>
  <li>Use <em>mkdir</em> to create a subdirectory of
     <em>Lab01</em> called <em>Hal</em>.
     Verify that the new directory was created by using
     the <em>ls</em> command.</li><br>
  <li>Use <em>cd</em> to change to the directory <em>Mammals</em>,
     and verify that you're in the <em>Mammals</em> directory
     using <em>pwd</em>.</li><br>
  <li>List the files and directories in <em>Mammals</em> using <em>ls</em>;
     then lists the contents of the <em>Cats</em> subdirectory by typing
     <kbd>ls Cats</kbd>.</li><br>
  <li>Change to the Cats directory using <em>cd</em>
     and display the contents of the directory.
     (By now you should begin to know which commands do what.)</li><br>
  <li>List only the files with names containing the string &ldquo;cat&rdquo;
     by typing the command <kbd>ls *cat*</kbd>.
     The &lsquo;*&rsquo; character is a wildcard that can stand
     for any sequence of zero or more characters.
     Compare the filtered file list with the complete list.
     Which files were eliminated by the filter and why?</li><br>
  <li>Display the contents of the file kittycat by typing
     <kbd>more kittyCat</kbd>.</li><br>
  <li>Change to the directory above the current working directory
     by typing <kbd>cd ..</kbd>&nbsp;.
     (Recall that &ldquo;..&rdquo; is a name for the parent of the
     current directory.)</p>
  <li>Copy the <em>2cats</em> file to the <em>Hal</em>directory
     using a single <em>cp</em> command.
     Work out names relative to the current working directory
     for the file to be copied and the directory it is to be copied to
     before actually typing the command.
     (Hint: Assuming the current working directory is <em>Mammals</em>,
     <em>2cats</em> is in the <em>Cats</em> sub-directory, and <em>Hal</em>
     is a sub-directory of the working directory's parent directory.)
     Verify that the file has been copied correctly by listing the contents
     of both the <em>Hal</em> and <em>Cats</em> directories.
     </li><br>
  <li>Change the working directory back to <em>Lab01</em>,
     and verify the command with <em>pwd</em>.</li><br>
  <li>Create a new <em>Puppy</em>directory as a sub-directory of the
     <em>Hal</em> directory without changing the working directory.
     (The name of the new directory is &ldquo;Hal/Puppy&rdquo;
     relative to the working directory.)</li><br>
  <li>Copy all of the files from <em>Dogs</em> into the <em>Puppy</em>
     directory using a single <em>cp</em> command.
     (&ldquo;Mammals/Dogs/*&rdquo; names all the files in <em>Dogs</em>
     directory by using the wildcard character.)
     List the files in the <em>Puppy</em> directory to verify the copy.</li><br>
  <li>Move the <em>Puppy</em> directory from <em>Hal</em>to the
     <em>Mammals/Dogs</em> directory using the <em>mv</em> command.
     List the contents of the <em>Hal</em> and <em>Dogs</em> directories
     to verify that <em>Puppy</em> is now in <em>Dogs</em> and not in
     <em>Hal</em>.</li><br>
  <li>Now that you have had a chance to use some Linux commands in action,
     build the following directory structure (just the <em>Critters</em>
     branch) using your own sequence of terminal commands.
     Verify that you have built the structure correctly using the
     <em>tree</em> command.</li>
</ol>

</p>

<p>
Complete your report for Part 1 and save it one last time.
Verify that the name of this file begins with your last name and
first name.
Show your report to the instructor or TA before you go on to Part 2.</p>


<h3>Part 2: Completing a simple Java program</h3>

<p>
Open a terminal window if you don't already have one.
If necessary, change the current working directory to
<em>CS160/Lab01</em>.
Verify that you have a file named <em>MouseIndicator.class</em>
in the directory;
if not, you can copy it from the directory
<code>/usr/people/classes/CS160/labs/Lab01</code>
into the current directory, using &ldquo;.&rdquo; as the
second argument to <em>cp</em>.
We'll run this program from the terminal instead of from inside DrJava.
Type <kbd>java MouseIndicator</kbd> at the prompt.
Press and release the mouse a few times in the window that pops up.
Notice what this program does: 
when you press the mouse button in the window, the word &ldquo;up&rdquo;
becomes black and the word &ldquo;down&rdquo; becomes red;
when you release the mouse button, the &ldquo;up&rdquo; becomes red
and the &ldquo;down&rdquo; becomes black.</p>

<p>
You are given in incomplete version of this program that you are to
complete so that it works just like the original.
Your assignment here is to complete a program that works in this way.
Open the file <em>MyMouseIndicator.java</em> in DrJava and add appropriate
statements to make it work as specified.
Your instructor will give you information about the statements you need
to use either in the class before the lab or in the lab itself.</p>

<p>
If you don't finish during the lab time and need help
completing this assignment, there
are TAs available every evening except Friday and Saturday in Peter
Engel Room 212 (this lab) and in the Clemens Library at St Ben's.
Check the TA website
<a href="https://sharepoint.csbsju.edu/computerscience/Pages/labhours.aspx">https://sharepoint.csbsju.edu/computerscience/Pages/labhours.aspx</a>
for hours.</p>

<p>
Show your completed program to the instructor or TA before you leave
today's lab or at the <em>beginning</em> of the next lab to receive full
credit.</p>
