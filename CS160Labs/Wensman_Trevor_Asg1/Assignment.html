    <h3>
      Problem 1&#8212;BMI
    </h3>

    <p>
      Write a <em>Program</em>, BMI, that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI).
      Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight
      that applies to adult men and women. BMI can be used to indicate if you
      are overweight, obese, underweight, or normal. If your BMI is 30 or more,
      that might not be good. However, the simple BMI calculation tends to
      overestimate BMI in people who are muscular or athletic. Therefore, if
      your BMI score seems too high, you may not be overweight, just athletic.
      BMI is calculated based on a person's weight and height. The math formula
      for calculating BMI is:
    </p>

    <pre>
    <em>weight(lb) * 703 / height(in)<sup style="font-size: 50%;">2</sup></em></pre>

    <p>
      The file <code>BMI.java</code> is included as a starting point for you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Example input/output:
    </p>

    <img style="height: 150px;" alt="Problem1" src="Problem1.png" />

    <h3>
      Problem 2&#8212;DigitSum
    </h3>

    <p>
      Write another <em>Program</em>, DigitSum, that accepts an integer value
      from the user and prints the sum of its digits. You may assume that the
      number is non-negative. For example, if the user input the number 29107,
      then your program should print 19, which is 2+9+1+0+7. <em>Hint: use the %
      (modulo) operator to extract a digit from a number.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Example input/output:
    </p>

    <img style="height: 200px;" alt="Problem2" src="Problem2.png" />

    <h3>
      Problem 3&#8212;Pi
    </h3>

    <p>
      Write a final <em>Program</em>, Pi, that calculates the value of pi from
      the infinite series: 
    </p>
    
    <pre>
    &pi;=4/1-4/3+4/5-4/7+4/9-4/11+&hellip;</pre>
   
    <p> 
      Note that for each term, the <code>+/-</code> sign alternates. Print a
      table that shows the value of pi approximated by computing a given number
      of terms. How many terms of this series do you have to compute before you
      first get 3.14? 3.141? 3.1415? 3.14159? <strong>The program that you turn
      in MUST compute just the first 100 terms</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Example output:
    </p>

    <img style="height: 200px;" alt="Problem3" src="Problem3.png" />

    <h3>
      Submitting your assignment
    </h3>

    <p>
      Copy the folder <code><em>LastName_FirstName</em>_Asg1</code> containing
      <code>BMI.java</code>, <code>DigitSum.java</code>, and
      <code>Pi.java</code> into, <code>/usr/people/handins/CS160</code> before
      the due date.
