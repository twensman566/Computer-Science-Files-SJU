    <h3>
      Problem 1&#8212;Tree
    </h3>

    <p>
      Write a Java class <code>Tree</code> that is a Java implementation of the
      GNU utility <kbd>tree</kbd>, which you should be familiar with from
      prelabs.
      The class should define the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Private static methods
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>tree(String, String)</code> &#8212; takes two
            <code>String</code> reference variables as parameters. The first
            <code>String</code> will be the path, i.e.,
            <kbd>/usr/people/...</kbd>, for which we are creating the tree. The
            second <code>String</code> will be a line prefix, i.e., the prefix
            that will be added to each line to indicate the level in the file
            hierarchy to which it belongs
          </li>
          <br>
          A sample algorithm for the <code>tree(String, String)</code> method
          might look something like:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Get a list of files/directories contained in the path that was
              passed as an argument
            </li>
            <li>
              For each of those, do the following:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Print some prefix, indicating its depth in the file hierarchy,
                  followed by <code>&quot;|-- &lt;name&gt; &quot;</code>, where
                  <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> should be replaced with its name
                </li>
                <li>
                  After printing its name, generate the tree for the
                  files/directories that it contains by calling
                  <code>tree(String, String)</code> recursively. You should
                  append its name to the path that was passed as a parameter, as
                  well as adjust the prefix appropriately to indicate that the
                  subsequent tree is at a deeper level in the file hierarchy
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              If you really want to get fancy, do the above two steps for all
              but the last file/directory. For the last, print the prefix
              followed by <code>&quot;`-- &lt;name&gt;&quot;</code>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Public static methods
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>tree(String)</code> &#8212; takes a single <code>String</code>
            reference variable as a parameter. The parameter is the path, i.e.,
            <kbd>/usr/people/...</kbd>, for which we are creating the tree. This
            method is the entry point for the recursive method
            <code>tree(String, String)</code> described above. It will simply
            call the recursive <code>tree</code> method, passing its parameter
            as the first parameter and the empty string
            <code>&quot;&quot;</code> as the second parameter.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Your program should include the ability to be invoked (run) from the
      command line. If it is invoked without any arguments, then it should
      create a tree for the directory <code>&quot;.&quot;</code>. If it is
      invoked with any number of arguments greater than zero, then it should
      create a tree for each of those.
