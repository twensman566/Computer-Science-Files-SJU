<h1>Lab 15: Using Swing Components&#8212;a Calculator</h1>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Part 1: A Simple Decimal Calculator</h2>




<p>
You have been give the start of a simple decimal calculator program,
<em>Calculator.java</em>.
Compile and run this program, experimenting with it until you
understand how it works.
Note that the program doesn't have a pull-down menu or &#8220;Quit&#8221;
button, so you'll have to stop it manually, even if you close the window.</p>

<p>
In this part you will finish constructing the simple calculator.
Modify the <em>Calculator.java</em> program to create a simple
general purpose calculator that operates on two
fields (First and Second) containing numeric values and puts the
result in the Answer field.</p>

<p>
Follow the procedure suggested in the comments in file
to add all the additional functionality.
A wise approach would be to  create the button panel, add the 
&#8216;+&#8217; button to it, and add that panel to the content
pane (Swing-speak for canvas), instead of the button.
Make sure the program works with this change before you go on.</p>

<p>
Now add a second button to the button panel, and add its
functionality to the <code>ActionPerformed()</code> method.
Once you have the second button working, go ahead and add the
rest of the functions and check your work.</p>

<p>
For functions requiring two numbers, like &#8216;+&#8217;,
&#8216;&#8722;&#8217;, &#8216;×&#8217; and &#8216;÷&#8217;,
both  the <em>First</em> and <em>Second</em> fields are used;
for functions requiring one number
like &#8220;log&#8221; and &#8220;tan&#8221;,
the operator works on the value in the <em>First</em> field
and displays result in the <em>Answer</em> field.
&#8220;+/&#8722; First&#8221; changes
the sign of the number in the <em>First</em> field;
other functions that specify one or more fields work similarly.
Use the <em>Math</em> class for log and trig functions.</p>

<p>
Finally, add a &#8220;Quit&#8221; button that stops your program
by executing the statement <code>System.exit(0)</code>;.</p>

<p>
Note: There are several parts of this program that use Java features
we haven't studied very much yet.
Just leave them as they are, and your program should work fine.</p>
