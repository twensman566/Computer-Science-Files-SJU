      Lab 11: Lists and iterators&mdash;managing a list of names
    </h2>

    <p>
      In this lab, you will create a simple list manager that allows you to
      build and maintain a list of names.
    </p>

    <p>
      As usual, begin by copying the folder for this lab from the common lab
      directory into your own directory.

    <h3>
      Part 1: Extending the HTLUtilities class
    </h3>

    <p>
      The program you'll be creating needs to be able to build a list of names,
      add more names later, find names, remove names and display the list. In
      order to do all this, the program will use a
      <em>HeadTailList&lt;String&gt;</em>, supported by static methods in the
      <em>HTLUtilities</em> class. Some of the methods you'll need are not yet
      present in the class, so your first job is to implement them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first method you need is one that builds a list of names. The
      <em>HTLUtilities</em> class already has two methods that build a list of
      integers, but no methods for building a list of strings. For our purposes,
      it's probably better to use the signal form, since we can pick a signal
      string that won't represent a name. Use the <code>readIntListSig()</code>
      method as a model for a <code>readStringListSig()</code> method; implement
      the version with a prompt string parameter that is used in the call to
      <code>readLine()</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Adding names is almost trivial if you don't mind adding to the front of
      the list. All you need to do is construct a new
      <em>LinkedHeadTailList</em> with the new element as the <em>head</em> and
      the existing list as the <em>tail</em>, so you don't need to add any new
      methods to <em>HTLUtilities</em> for this function. <em>HTLUtilities</em>
      already contains a <code>cull()</code> method that you can use to remove
      an item from a list.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finding a name in the list will require a new method. In this case, all we
      want to do is determine whether a particular name is in the list or not.
      You can implement a generic <code>find()</code> method on the same pattern
      as the <code>count()</code> method, but this method two
      parameters&mdash;the list and the element to be searched for&mdash;and it
      returns a <em>boolean</em>. There are three cases: if the list is empty,
      the method should return <em>false</em>; if the head element equals the
      element being searched for, it should return <em>true</em>; otherwise, it
      should return the result of searching the tail of the list for the
      element. Note that this recursive method actually has two base cases; also
      note that you must use the <code>equals()</code> method to compare
      elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, we need to be able to display the elements of a list. Implement a
      generic method that prints the elements, one per line. If the list is
      empty it should print the message &ldquo;EMPTY LIST&rdquo;; otherwise it
      should print the head element and then recursively print the tail of the
      list, <em>only if the tail is not empty</em>. (Why?)
    </p>

    <p>
      You may write a simple test program for your methods if you wish, or you
      may use the program in Part 2 to test the methods. Do show your code to
      the TA or lab instructor before you go on.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Part 2: A simple names manager
    </h3>

    <p>
      Write a simple <em>ConsoleProgram</em> that builds and maintains a list of
      names (<em>String</em>s). Use the <code>init()</code> method to initialize
      any instance variables and put the code that operates the program in the
      <code>run()</code> method. Any operations you do on the list should use
      methods already available in the <em>HeadTailList</em> interface and the
      <em>HTLUtilities</em> class.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program should begin with an appropriate introductory message and then
      build the initial list. Once the list is built, it enters a command
      interpreter loop that continues until a &ldquo;quit&rdquo; command is
      issued. The loop should have the following shape:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do {<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//
        statements comprising the body of the loop<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while (!cmd.equals("quit"));
      </code>
    </p>

    <p>
      The body of the loop begins by displaying a menu of the available
      commands. The allowed commands should be &ldquo;add&rdquo;,
      &ldquo;find&rdquo;, &ldquo;remove&rdquo;, &ldquo;display&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;quit&rdquo;. The user then enters a command. The program uses an
      <code>if&ndash;else if&ndash;else</code> structure to execute the command,
      comparing the entered command to the target command in each condition
      part.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the &ldquo;add&rdquo;, &ldquo;find&rdquo; and &ldquo;remove&rdquo;
      commands, the program prompts the user for the associated name and then
      executes the appropriate methods to accomplish the command. In the case of
      the &ldquo;add&rdquo; command, the new name should only be added if it is
      not already present, so you'll need to use the <code>find()</code> method
      here; print a confirmation message stating either that the name was added
      or that it was already present. The &ldquo;find&rdquo; command simply
      determines whether the name is present or not and prints an appropriate
      message. The &ldquo;remove&rdquo; command should first determine whether
      the name is present or not, only calling the <code>cull()</code> method to
      remove it if it is there; it should print a message indicating which of
      the two cases occurred.
    </p>

    <p>
      The remaining two commands are simple: the &ldquo;display&rdquo; command
      just calls the appropriate method in the <em>HTLUtilities</em> class; the
      &ldquo;quit&rdquo; command does nothing since it's only a signal to exit
      the loop and end the program. The final <code>else</code> clause is
      reached if the user enters a command that isn't recognized; in this case,
      print a suitable error message.
    </p>

    <p>
      Test your program thoroughly and then show it to the TA or lab instructor.
