    <h3>
      Preliminaries
    </h3>

    <p>
      Using a terminal window, copy the directory named <kbd>Lab04</kbd> from
      <kbd>/usr/people/classes/CS160/labs</kbd> into your <kbd>CS160</kbd>
      directory. Use the <kbd>tree</kbd> command to verify that the directory
      structure for your local copy of <kbd>Lab04</kbd> matches the following:
    </p>

    <pre style="color: #d33682;">
    Lab04
    |-- LaundrySorter.java
    |-- Prelab.html
    |-- RandomColors.java
    `-- solution
        |-- LaundrySorter.class
        `-- RandomColors.class
    </pre>

    <h3>
      Pre-lab exercise: Drawing randomly-colored lines
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      The file <kbd>RandomColor.java</kbd> contains a program that generates
      green lines on the canvas when the user drags the mouse around the canvas.
      Open the file in DrJava. Compile and run the program, comparing the code
      with the way the program works. When you are satisfied that you understand
      how the program does what it does, begin working on modifying the program.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Note: If you get stuck and need to start over, you can make a new copy of
      the original program instead of trying to unwind all the changes you
      made.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You are to modify the program so that instead of drawing only green lines,
      the color for each line is selected randomly from red, green, blue, black,
      and yellow. You can do this by using the random number generator as in
      <a href="../Lab03/Lab.html">Lab 3</a> to choose a number between 0.0 and
      1.0 and then using an <code>if</code>-statement to set the color based on
      the number that was generated: 0.0&#8211;0.2 for red, 0.2&#8211;0.4 for
      green, etc. This selection statement could look something like this:
    </p>
    
    <pre>
    double selection = Math.random();
    if (selection &lt;= 0.2)
    {
      currentColor = Color.RED;
    }
    else if (selection &lt;= 0.4)
    {
      currentColor = Color.GREEN;
    }
    &#8942;</pre>
    
    <p>
      You'll need two more <code>else if</code>-clauses and an
      <code>else</code>-clause
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Test your program to assure yourself that it works correctly. Add
      appropriate comments if you have not already done so. Show your working
      program and code to the lab instructor or TA at the <em>beginning</em> of
      lab.
