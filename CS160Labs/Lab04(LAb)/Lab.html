    <h3>
      Part 1: A laundry-sorting simulation
    </h3>

    <p>
      Open the file <kbd>LaundrySorter.java</kbd> in DrJava.
    </p>

    <p>
      As college students, it is important to learn the proper way to sort
      laundry. In this part of the lab, you will write a Java program that
      simulates sorting laundry. The initial display should display a
      rectangle&#8212;the hamper&#8212;that is white, black, or red,
      representing a white, dark, or colored item of clothing at the top of the
      hamper. Next to this rectangle should be three rectangles that represent
      three tubs of laundry, <em>Whites</em>, <em>Darks</em>, and
      <em>Colors</em> and have appropriate colors and text labels. The user is
      to look at the color of the &#8220;clothing item&#8221; (colored
      rectangle) in the hamper and click on the appropriate tub. Each time the
      user correctly selects a tub, the item of clothing will be randomly
      replaced by another black, white, or other-colored item. If the user
      selects the wrong tub, the program should display an error message, and
      the clothing item should be unchanged; the error message should be hidden
      when the user selects a tub correctly.
    </p>

    <p>
      You will need to use the <code>getColor()</code> and <code>equals()</code>
      methods as well as an <code>if</code>-statement to determine if the colors
      match. The following code fragment should get you started:
    </p>

    <pre>
    GObject objectClicked = this.getElementAt(e.getX(), e.getY()); // objectClicked is now the object that the mouse was clicked on
    Color binColor        = objectClicked.getColor();
    Color hamperColor     = this.hamper.getColor();

    if (binColor.equals(hamperColor))
    {</pre>

    <p>
      When you are successful in creating the basic laundry game, show your lab
      instructor or TA.
    </p>


    <h3>
      Part 2: Keeping count of events
    </h3>

    <p>
      Change the laundry program so that it counts and displays the number of
      correct and incorrect choices the user has made. Your can do this by
      adding two <code>int</code> instance variables <code>correct</code> and
      <code>wrong</code>, both initialized to 0, adding the statement
      <code>this.correct++;</code> wherever you detect a correct choice and
      adding the statement <code>this.wrong++;</code> wherever you detect an
      incorrect choice. Use <code>GLabel</code>s on the canvas to display the
      current values of <code>correct</code> and <code>wrong</code>; use the
      <code>setLabel()</code> method to change the text value of the label.
    </p>

    <p>
      Show your finished program to the lab instructor or TA.
