    <h2>
      Creating a Typing Game
    </h2>

    <p>
      Your final lab project will be to create a game that can be used to
      improve a user's typing skills. The basic idea of the game is as follows.
      Random words &#8220;float&#8221; across the screen. The user types the
      words into a <code>JTextField</code> and presses enter.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        If the typist types the word correctly, points are awarded to the typist.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the word typed does not match, or if the word floats off the screen
        prior to the typist typing the word, the typist receives a strike.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Once the typist receives three strikes, the game is over. We wish to have
      multiple degrees of difficulty for the game based on word length and the
      speed at which words appear and disappear off of the screen.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Preliminaries
    </h3>

    <p>
      Using a terminal window, copy the directory named <kbd>Lab18</kbd> from
      <kbd>/usr/people/classes/CS160/labs</kbd> into your <kbd>CS160</kbd>
      directory. Use the <kbd>tree</kbd> command to verify that the directory
      structure for your local copy of <kbd>Lab18</kbd> matches the following:
    </p>

    <pre style="color: #d33682;">

    <h3>
      Part 1: Creating a random word generator<span style="background:yellow;
      color:red; font-weight:bold;">(In lab)</span>
    </h3>

    <p>
      In order to float words across a screen, we need to have a source of words
      of varying length. One way to do this is to take a large document and then
      use the words in that file as a source of words. The <kbd>vbush.txt</kbd>
      text file is available in your lab directory. <b>(P.S. The text file
      provided is an article written by Vannebar Bush in 1945. In the article,
      he describes many of the concepts behind the World Wide Web when there
      were few computers in the world!)</b>. From the command line we can use
      the <kbd>wc</kbd> command on file <kbd>vbush.txt</kbd> to find out how
      many words are in the file (i.e. <kbd>wc vbush.txt</kbd>). The
      <kbd>wc</kbd> command prints the <i>line</i>, <i>word</i>, and <i>byte</i>
      counts for the specified file.
    </p>

    <p>
      Report the number of words in the file to your TA or lab instructor.
    </p>

    <p>
      This file contains plenty of words, but is not quite ready for use. Since
      our game is intended to send individual words on the screen one at a time
      we will want to remove all punctuations such as commas (,) , periods (.) ,
      colons (:), semicolons (;), apostrophes(&#8216;), dashes(-), and
      exclamation (!) and question marks (?) as well other characters (such as
      /, @, (, ) and ~) that show up in the file. In addition, we wish to sort
      the words based on word size.
    </p>

    <p>
      Step one in your game development is to create a <code>WordSorter</code>
      Java class. This class should have a <code>public static void main(String
      [] args)</code> method in order to run it from the command line with an
      input filename as an argument (for which you will provide
      <code>vbush.txt</code>). It should generate three new files that will
      contain small (3-5 letters), medium (6-8 letters) and large (&gt;8
      letters)<span style="background:yellow; color:red;
      font-weight:bold;"> (ignore words of length 2 or less)</span> words where
      the words in the input file have been cleaned (i.e. filtered to remove the
      punctuation and other characters). You will be reading words from the
      input file one at a time, cleaning them, and writing them to one of the
      three files. Class <code>String</code> has method
      <code>replaceAll(String&nbsp;match,&nbsp;String&nbsp;replacement)</code>
      that can be used for cleaning purposes; e.g., to remove
      <code>&#8220;@&#8221;</code> from a <code>String x</code>, you can write
      <code>x&nbsp;=&nbsp;x.replaceAll(&#8220;@&#8221;,&nbsp;&#8220;&#8221;)</code>.
      This replaces all matches of <code>&#8220;@&#8221;</code> with the empty
      string which effectively removes the matches. You can also specify a
      <em>character class</em> to remove all of them simultaneously; e.g., to
      remove <code>/</code>, <code>@</code>, <code>%</code> and <code>$</code>,
      along with other punctuation characters recognized by Java, you can use
      <code>x&nbsp;=&nbsp;x.replaceAll(&#8220;\\p{Punct}&#8221;,&#8220;&#8221;)</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, create a <code>RandomWord</code> class that takes a filename as a
      parameter in its constructor and has a <code>next()</code> method that
      will return a word from the specified file at random. Do this by reading
      the words in the specified file into an
      <code>ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</code> and then generating a random location
      number using the <code>Random</code> class to find the next word to
      return. Class <code>BannerMover</code> uses a
      <code>RandomIntGenerator</code> to randomly access words from the
      <code>ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</code> defined in its constructor; you might
      want to follow the steps outline there.
    </p>

    <p>
      Write a short demo program that uses the <code>RandomWord</code> class and
      show your Lab Instructor or TA that you have successfully completed this
      part of the program.
    </p>

    <!--<h3>
      Part 2: Creating an Appropriate GUI
    </h3>

    <p>
      The second step is to design the GUI that you intend to use. Remember that
      you need to have a way for the user to select the difficulty level, a
      canvas for the words to float across the screen, a place for the user to
      type, a place to show the score and the number of strikes (or number of
      strikes left). Also include a Start and an Exit button. You should first
      sketch your design on paper and show it to your Lab Instructor or TA and
      then develop the code that provides all the GUI components needed. The
      functionality behind the GUI components can be developed later.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Part 3: Sending Words Across the Screen
    </h3>

    <p>
      Some of the work for this part is done in that you have access to the
      <code>Banner</code> and <code>BannerMover</code> classes. You can use them
      and modify them as you like. Remember that you need to send multiple words
      across the screen (travel horizontally from left to right) without user
      action. <span style="background:yellow; color:red; font-weight:bold;">The
      banner containing the word should be removed from canvas after the user
      types in his/her word and hits enter.</span> You may want to look
      carefully at the <code>BannerController</code> class. A variation of this
      might help you send words across the screen. For now, send the words
      across the screen one at a time. This makes it easier to determine if a
      word typed matches the word on the screen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, class <code>BannerMover</code> uses a <code>Random</code>
      object to randomly access random words from the
      <code>ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</code> defined in its constructor. You need
      to change class <code>BannerMover</code> so that its constructor will take
      a word string and a speed. Your application should allow for speeds and
      random words based on the level of difficulty selected by the user (for
      easy level, use slow speed and the small words file; for medium level, use
      medium speed and the medium words file; and for hard level, use fast speed
      and the long words file). You can use the <code>RandomWord</code> class
      created in Part I to generate the words.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Part 4: Putting It Together
    </h3>

    <p>
      You now need to tie everything together where actions are tied to the GUI.
      You will also need to determine whether or not the word typed by the user
      matches the word on a banner. Whenever this occurs, the word banner should
      be removed from the screen and a new word banner should be generated. If a
      word is mistyped or if a word floats off the screen and disappears, you
      should mark it against the user; otherwise, the user gets credit for
      typing the word correctly. <span style="background:yellow; color:red;
      font-weight:bold;">The game should end when the user gets three
      strikes.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      Feel free to add additional functionality and style to the game. You may
      want to have multiple words float across the screen at once or have them
      float from different locations at random. (Be sure you have the basic
      program working first and that you save a copy of it before trying
      additional features.)
    </p>

    <h3>
      Part 5: Document code using JavaDoc
    </h3>

    <p>
      You should carefully document your program with appropriate comments
      throughout. When you have finished the program, you should create the
      JavaDocs for your program.
    </p>


    <h3>
      Submitting Your Project <span style="background: yellow; color:red;
      font-weight:bold;">(DUE: Friday May 5 by 5:00 PM &#8211; absolutely no
      late projects accepted)</span>
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      When you have the lab working correctly, create a new folder inside your
      Lab directory and give it a name similar in format to
      <em>Iverson_Jeremy_Lab18</em> only using your name. Copy everything from
      your Lab directory and put it in the newly created directory (but
      keep the old copies in their place as back up). Put a copy of your newly
      renamed directory into the <code>/usr/people/handins/CS160</code>
      directory before the due date. You can use the <code>cp -r</code> command
      or copy and paste to hand in your work.
