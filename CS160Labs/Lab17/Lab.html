    <h2>
      Classes using classes&#8212;Traffic Signals
    </h2>

    <p>
      In this lab, you will explore building new classes upon existing classes,
      where the classes are specified by interfaces. The general problem is to
      build a class that models a signal-controlled, four-way intersection. For
      today, we'll do a text-based model. The intersection will be built with
      four traffic signals for the four directions of travel, and the signal
      will be built with three lights, labeled by color. We'll implement the
      classes from the bottom up.

    <h3>
      Part 1: Creating a TextLight class that implements the Light interface
    </h3>

    <p>
      The first task is to complete a class implementing the <code>Light</code>
      interface. The class must have a different name than the interface, and
      the usual Java convention is to end the class name with the interface
      name, starting it with something that briefly describes the way the class
      is implemented. Since this will be a text-based implementation, it makes
      sense to call the class <code>TextLight</code>. To begin this class, open
      a new Java document in DrJava and copy the entire contents of
      <kbd>Light.java</kbd> into the document. Save the file in your lab folder
      as <kbd>TextLight.java</kbd>. This gives you an interface that can serve
      as an accurate template for the class. Before you go on, modify the class
      JavaDoc comments to reflect the change from interface to class.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are the general steps to convert an interface into a class:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Change the interface declaration to a class declaration
        </li>
        <li>
          Declare instance variables
        </li>
        <li>
          Declare and implement constructor methods
        </li>
        <li>
          Implement all declared methods
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The only instance variable we need for a <code>TextLight</code> object is
      one to determine whether the light is on or off. We could use a boolean
      variable for this purpose, but instead, we'll use the
      <code>LightState</code> <em>enum</em>. Declare the instance variable after
      the class declaration as follows:
      <br>
    </p>

    <pre>
    private LightState state;</pre>

    <p>
      The enum declaration effectively creates two distinct <code>static final
      int</code> values: <code>LightState.OFF</code> and
      <code>LightState.ON</code>. We can now use these names directly in our
      programs.
    </p>

    <p>
      We only need one constructor for the <code>TextLight</code> class. We
      could design a constructor that would take a <code>LightState</code>
      parameter to set the initial state of the <code>TextLight</code>, but
      that's really more complicated than what we need. Instead, implement a
      constructor with no parameters, and set the initial value of
      <code>state</code> to <code>LightState.OFF</code>. This design better
      matches real world lights which don't come on until they're installed and
      supplied with electricity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, implement the methods specified by the <code>Light</code>
      interface. All of these should be no more than a few lines.
      For the <code>toString()</code> method, you need to construct one of two
      strings: <code>&#8220;TextLight.OFF&#8221;</code> or
      <code>&#8220;TextLight.ON&#8221;</code>. You can do that either using an
      <code>if</code>-statement or by concatenating the <code>state</code>
      variable to the string <code>&#8220;TextLight.&#8221;</code>. The latter
      method will probably construct a slightly different string, but that's
      alright if you prefer to do it that way. Return the result string.
    </p>

    <p>
      Use the included <code>LightTester</code> program to test your class and
      show it to the lab instructor or TA before moving on to Part 2.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Part 2: Creating a TextTrafficSignal class that implements the
      TrafficSignal interface
    </h3>

    <p>
      Follow the same steps to implement the <code>TextTrafficSignal</code>
      class that implements the <code>TrafficSignal</code> interface. There are
      a few differences, however. First, in addition to the instance variable
      for the state of the signal (type <code>TrafficSignalState</code>, in this
      case), there should be three <code>Light</code> instance variables for the
      three colored lights. The constructor can again have no parameters and set
      the initial <code>state</code> to <code>TrafficSignalState.OFF</code>; it
      must also create the three <code>Light</code> objects with the
      <code>new</code> operator and assign them to the appropriate instance
      variables. They will all be off initially, so it isn't necessary to change
      their values in the constructor. The mutator methods should correctly
      change both the signal state and the light states to reflect the overall
      state of the signal. Finally, the <code>toString()</code> method should
      display both the internal state value and the state values of the three
      lights. That is, it should return a string that looks something like:
      <br>
    </p>
    
    <pre>
    TrafficSignal: state.RED, red.ON, yellow.OFF, green.OFF</pre>
    
    <p>
      Use the included <code>SignalTester</code> program to test your class and
      show it to the lab instructor or TA before moving on to Part 3.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Part 3: Creating a TextIntersection class that implements the Intersection
      interface
    </h3>

    <p>
      Once again, follow the same steps to implement a
      <code>TextIntersection</code> class that implements the
      <code>Intersection</code> interface. For this class, there's no state
      variable. (The states begin to get too complicated to enumerate.) Instead,
      the state is determined by the state of four
      <code>TrafficSignal</code> objects, one each for northbound, eastbound,
      southbound and westbound traffic. The constructor and other methods are
      quite similar to the previous class, but the implementation will be a
      little more complicated. You should probably insert newline
      (<code>'\n'</code>) characters in the output of the
      <code>toString()</code> method to make display a little more readable.
      Maybe something like:
    </p>

    <pre>
    TextIntersection:
      north.TrafficSignal: state.RED, red.ON, yellow.OFF, green.OFF
      east.TrafficSignal: state.RED, red.ON, yellow.OFF, green.OFF
      south.TrafficSignal: state.RED, red.ON, yellow.OFF, green.OFF
      west.TrafficSignal: state.RED, red.ON, yellow.OFF, green.OFF</pre>

    <p>
      Use the included <code>IntersectionTester</code> program to test your
      class and show it to the lab instructor or TA.
