        <li>
          Work with your pair partner(s) on this lab but swap roles.&nbsp; If
          you were not the recorder last time, your role will be as recorder
          this time.

          Remember that all programs are expected to contain comments for public
          classes, variables, constants and methods.
        </li>
        <li>
          All comments set off with &#8220;***&#8221; are instructions to you as
          the programmer. You should remove or replace those comments once
          you've completed the instructions.

    <h3>
      Part 1: Animating the turtle and the hare
    </h3>

    <p>
      In this part of the lab we're going to redo the turtle and hare race so
      you don't have to continually click the mouse to run the race. We will now
      have classes called <code>ActiveTurtle</code> and <code>ActiveHare</code>
      that will run the race autonomously once they are started. The
      <code>ActiveTurtle</code> and <code>ActiveHare</code> classes will extend
      the <code>Animator</code> class, which allows objects to act independently
      of each other by running in separate <em>threads</em>. The
      <code>NewRace</code> class will create a turtle and a hare, put them on
      the race course and start them; the two runners will run their race until
      one of them reaches the finish line. Each runner will time him/herself
      (fairly!) and post her/his finish time on the canvas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Make one new Java file <kbd>Hare.java</kbd> and copy the contents of the
      file <kbd>Turtle.java</kbd> into it. Modify the files
      <kbd>Turtle.java</kbd> and <kbd>Hare.java</kbd> so they implement the
      <code>Turtle</code> and <code>Hare</code> classes, respectively; use your
      code from Lab 2 to make your classes draw the two animals. The
      <code>ActiveHare</code> and <code>ActiveTurtle</code> classes have
      instance variables of types <code>Hare</code> and <code>Turtle</code>,
      respectively. The <code>ActiveTurtle</code> class is completed for you;
      you should complete the <code>ActiveHare</code> class using the
      <code>ActiveTurtle</code> as a model.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Part 2: Adding another racer
    </h3>

    <p>
      Make a class for a new animal (not a turtle or hare) and a new
      corresponding active animal class. Modify the <code>NewRace</code> class
      so that there are three racers, including one of the new animal.
    </p>

    <p>
      As usual, when you are done with the in-lab exercises above, have your lab
      instructor or TA check over your work before you leave the lab.
