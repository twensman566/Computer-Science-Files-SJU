      Lab 7: Making simple animated simulations&#8212;animated boxes, turtles
      and hares
    </h2>

    <p>
      In this lab, you will complete several classes that will extend the
      <code>Animator</code> class to get a better handle on how to create
      classes that have objects that run independently.

      Notes:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Remember that all programs are expected to contain comments for public
          classes, variables, constants and methods.
        </li>
        <li>
          All comments set off with &#8220;***&#8221; are instructions to you as
          the programmer. You should remove or replace those comments once
          you've completed the instructions.

    <p>
      Using a terminal window, copy the directory named <kbd>Lab07</kbd> from
      <kbd>/usr/people/classes/CS160/labs</kbd> into your <kbd>CS160</kbd>
      directory. Use the <kbd>tree</kbd> command to verify that the directory
      structure for your local copy of <kbd>Lab07</kbd> matches the following:

    <h3>
      Pre-lab exercise: A sliding box
    </h3>

    <p>
      Start DrJava and open the file <kbd>BoxController.java</kbd> from your lab
      directory. The <code>BoxController</code> class is similar to others that
      we have seen that extend the <code>GraphicsProgram</code> class. Its
      <code>init()</code> method simply creates one line of text (a
      <code>GLabel</code>), and its <code>mouseClicked()</code> method hides
      that text and creates an <code>ActiveBox</code> object at the point of the
      click. The <code>ActiveBox</code> will take care of itself, moving across
      the screen from left to right.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now open the file <kbd>ActiveBox.java</kbd>; in it you will see a template
      for the <code>ActiveBox</code> class. It defines constants for the time to
      pause between movements (<code>DELAY_TIME</code>) and the speed at which
      to move across the canvas (<code>X_SPEED</code>). You are to complete the
      code for the <code>run()</code> method.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>run()</code> method will consist of a <code>while</code>-loop
      that runs as long as the box has not moved beyond the right edge of the
      canvas. You'll need to find a boolean expression involving the box size,
      the current x-position of the box and the width of the canvas to control
      the loop; use the <code>getX()</code> and <code>getWidth()</code> methods,
      respectively, to get those two values. Inside the loop, the box moves to
      the right by a distance of <code>X_SPEED</code>, and then pauses for the
      defined delay time. After the <code>while</code>-loop, remove the box from
      the canvas using the <code>remove()</code> method.
    </p>
