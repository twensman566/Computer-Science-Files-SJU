    <h2>
      Lab 5: Loops and classes&#8212;bullseyes and bowling pins
    </h2>

    <p>
      In this lab, you will gain experience defining classes and implementing
      methods that require the use of loops.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Preliminaries
    </h3>

    <p>
      Using a terminal window, copy the directory named <kbd>Lab05</kbd> from
      <kbd>/usr/people/classes/CS160/labs</kbd> into your <kbd>CS160</kbd>
      directory. Use the <kbd>tree</kbd> command to verify that the directory
      structure for your local copy of <kbd>Lab05</kbd> matches the following:
    </p>

    <h3>
      Pre-lab exercise: the Bullseye
    </h3>

    <p>
      Open the files <kbd>BullseyePlacer.java</kbd> and <kbd>Bullseye.java</kbd>
      in DrJava. These files contain a template for the <code>Bullseye</code>
      program, which draws a bullseye similar to the Target logo on the canvas.
      Using a loop, the program should draw six concentric filled-in circles,
      with the color alternating between red and black. The biggest should be
      120 pixels in diameter, with each subsequent circle decreasing 20 pixels
      in diameter. Each circle should be added to the <code>Bullseye</code>
      object being created, as it is created&#8212;this is accomplished by two
      statements.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        The first is included for you and is the statement <code>extends
        GCompound</code> in the <code>Bullseye</code> class declaration. The
        <code>GCompound</code> class is a convenience provided by the ACM
        library. It allows you to <em>add</em> objects to other objects like you
        would the canvas. This way, when the parent object, i.e., the object
        which other objects are being added to, is finally added to the canvas,
        all of its child objects will be added automatically.
      </li>

      <li>
        The second is the <code>add()</code> method which is implemented for the
        <code>Bullseye</code> class because it <code>extends GCompound</code>.
        You can use it as follows: <code>this.add(circle, x, y);</code>, where
        <code>circle</code> is a <code>GOval</code> reference variable and
        <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the x- and y-offsets from the
        <code>Bullseye</code> object to which <code>circle</code> is being
        added.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Note that you should only modify the <kbd>Bullseye.java</kbd> file; keep
      the file <kbd>BullseyePlacer.java</kbd> unchanged.
    </p>

    <p>
      Test your program to assure yourself that it works correctly. Add
      appropriate comments if you have not already done so. Show your working
      program and code to the lab instructor or TA at the <em>beginning</em> of
      lab.
