      Lab 3: Graphical programs &amp; simple computation&#8212;the Turtle and
      the Hare
    </h2>

    <h3>Objectives</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Have students write programs using graphics objects.
      </li>
      <li>
        Familiarize students with the use of random numbers.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In this lab, you will write a Java program that displays a race between
      two different objects, an oval and a rectangle, representing a turtle
      and a hare, respectively. With each mouse click, each racer should move a
      random distance to the right until one of the racers crosses the finish
      line. You will do this by modifying the file <code>Race.java</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Preliminaries
    </h3>

    <p>
      If you have not already done so, you must complete the pre-lab exercise
      for this lab before you can proceed to the in-lab parts.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Part 1: Moving the racers
    </h3>

    <p>
      As you noticed when you tested the <code>Race.class</code> program in the
      <code>solution</code>, the racers advance a little bit each time you click
      the mouse in the race canvas. You shouldn't be surprised, then, that it's
      the method named <code>mouseclicked()</code> that handles this behavior in
      the program. This part of the lab will consist of adding statements to the
      <code>mouseclicked()</code> method so that it produces the desired
      behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the methods available for objects of the <em>GObject</em> class
      (including <em>GOval</em>, <em>GRect</em> and <em>GLine</em>) is the
      <code>move()</code> method, which moves a graphical object the specified
      distance in pixels. The method takes two parameters, the first is for
      horizontal distance and the second for vertical distance. Negative values
      for horizontal movement cause the object to move left; positive values
      cause it to move right. Similarly, negative values for vertical movement
      cause the object to move up; positive values cause it to move down. You
      can use this method to move the racers across the track.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that the program already has the following local variable
      declaration in the <code>mouseClicked()</code> method:
    </p>

    <pre>
    double moveAmount;</pre>

    <p>
      This variable is intended to hold the number of pixels we want the racer
      to move, but it currently has no value. Use an assignment statement of the
      form <code>variableIdentifier&nbsp;=&nbsp;value;</code> to set the value
      of the <code>moveAmount</code> variable to 10.0; put it immediately after
      the declaration above. Next add two calls to the <code>move()</code>
      method; the first should be
      <code>this.turtle.move(moveAmount,&nbsp;0);</code> and the second should
      do the same thing for the hare.
    </p>

    <p>
      Compile and run the program. How does it behave?
    </p>

    <p>
      At this stage, the two racers should move to the right 10 pixels with each
      mouse click. This is a good start, but it's not how we want the program to
      behave. As you noticed when you tested <code>Race.class</code> in the
      <code>solution</code> directory, the racers move different amounts from
      each other and different amounts each time the mouse is clicked. We can
      achieve this behavior by varying the amount of movement each time one of
      the racers moves; the simplest way to get this variation is by using a
      random number generator. Try changing the assignment statement to the
      following:
    </p>

    <pre>
    moveAmount = 10.0 + 10.0 * Math.random();</pre>

    <p>
      Compile and run to see what happens. The racers should now move a
      different amount with each mouse click, but they're still both moving at
      the same pace. To fix that problem, we need to change the value of
      <code>moveAmount</code> before we move the hare.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before we change the amount, let's consider what the revised assignment
      statement does: it still sets 10.0 pixels as part of the move amount, but
      it adds 10 times the value of the expression <code>Math.random()</code>,
      which is a call to the <code>random()</code> method of the <em>Math</em>
      class. The <code>random()</code> method takes no parameters and returns a
      (pseudo)-random value between 0.0 and 1.0. Thus, the value assigned to
      <code>moveAmount</code> is now a random value in the range 10.0 to 20.0.
      That's a reasonable pattern of movement for the turtle&#8212;fairly slow
      and pretty steady&#8212;but it's not a good choice for the hare. The hare
      can run faster than the turtle, but it's also more likely to stop and
      rest. Add a second assignment statement to the variable
      <code>moveAmount</code> between the two <code>move()</code> calls that
      causes the hare's speed to vary randomly between 2.0 and 25.0 instead of
      between 10.0 and 20.0. Compile the revised program and run it several
      times to get an idea of who wins the race more often. If you like, try
      changing the movement formulas to see if you can get more interesting
      results.

      When you are successful in getting the basic racers to work correctly,
      show your lab instructor or TA.

    <h3>
      Part 2: Improving the racers' appearance
    </h3>

    <p>
      Make the hare and turtle more realistic by adding small objects like
      legs, heads, ears and eyes. (Use ovals, rectangles and lines of different
      sizes and colors.) Note that you will have to move each of the objects
      connected with a given racer the same amount at each step or your racers
      will literally fall apart.
