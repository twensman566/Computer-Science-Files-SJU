      Lab 3: Graphical programs &amp; simple computation&#8212;the Turtle and
      the Hare
    </h2>

    <h3>
      Objectives
    </h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        To write programs using graphics objects
      </li>
      <li>
        To become familiar with the use of random numbers.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In this lab, you will write a Java program that displays a race between
      two different objects, an oval and a rectangle, representing a turtle and
      a hare, respectively. With each mouse click, each racer should move a
      random distance to the right until one of the racers crosses the finish
      line. You will do this by modifying the file <code>Race.java</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Setup
    </h3>

    <p>
      Using a terminal window, copy the directory
      <code>/usr/people/classes/CS160/labs/Lab03</code> into your
      <code>CS160</code> directory. Use the <code>ls</code> command to verify
      that the directory is there and that it contains one Java file, namely
      <code>Race.java</code> and a directory called <code>solution</code>.
      Inside the <code>solution</code> directory, you should find a Java class
      file named <code>Race.class</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Testing a completed version of the program
    </h3>

    <p>
      To see how the program for this lab should work, go into your terminal
      window, change into directory <code>CS160/labs/Lab03/solution</code> and
      enter the command <code>java Race</code>, which causes the JVM to run the
      program <code>Race.class</code>. You may have to resize the window that
      comes up to see the whole race course. Then click away until the race is
      run. The program you create in this lab will do the same thing.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Pre-lab exercise
    </h3>

    <p>
      For the pre-lab, you will set up the initial race with the starting line,
      finish line, turtle (oval) and hare (rectangle). You accomplish this by
      declaring instance variables for each of the objects in the scene and then
      creating and setting up the objects in the <code>init()</code> method.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can place all constant and instance variable declarations in the area
      above the <code>init()</code> method.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>init()</code> method should place the objects on the canvas for
      the beginning of the race, including a vertical start line near the left
      edge, a vertical finish line near the right edge, a gray square to
      represent the hare and a green circle to represent the turtle, both placed
      just to the left of the start line, one a bit above the other.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Notice that the program already has the following declaration:
    </p>

    <pre>
    private GOval turtle;</pre>

    <p>
      We can create the turtle in the <code>init()</code> method after the first
      statement as follows:
    </p>

    <pre>
    this.turtle = new GOval(30, 20);
    this.add(this.turtle, 10, 10);</pre>

    <p>
      Compile and run this code. You should see the outline of a black oval in
      the upper-left corner. The turtle looks like this because the constructor
      call <code>new GOval(30, 20)</code>, followed by
      <code>this.add(this.turtle, 10, 10)</code>. Together these specify that an
      oval which is 30 pixels wide and 20 pixels high should be placed 10 pixels
      left and 10 pixels down from the upper-left corner; the default color for
      any graphical object is black, and it is also drawn as an outline by
      default. Experiment with changing the position and size of the oval by
      varying the parameters to the constructor call until you are satisfied
      that it looks about the same as the one in the Race program.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, change the color of the oval and set it so it's filled in. You can
      change the color with the <code>setColor()</code> method using the
      statement <code>this.turtle.setColor(Color.GREEN);</code> just between the
      two statements you added from above. The <code>setFilled()</code> method:
      <code>this.turtle.setFilled(true)</code> causes the oval to be filled
      instead of an outline. Compile and run the program to see the effect of
      adding these statements.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can create the hare in a similar way, but use a different shape,
      location and color for the hare. You'll essentially repeat the four
      statements you used to create the turtle, with the following changes:
      instead of the <em>GOval</em> constructor, call the <em>GRect</em>
      constructor, which takes the same two parameters; use a different location
      for the hare, but you can probably use the same width and height; choose a
      different color.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, you need to create the start and finish lines, which are both
      objects in the <em>GLine</em> class. The <em>GLine</em> constructor takes
      four parameters. The first two parameters are the <em>x-</em> and
      <em>y-coordinates</em> in pixels of the starting point of the line
      relative to the upper-left corner of the canvas; the last two parameters
      are the coordinates of the ending point of the line. Create the two lines
      and add them to the canvas, experimenting with the start and end points
      until you have them where you want them. (A little arithmetic and geometry
      might be helpful.) You can change the color of the lines with the same
      named <code>setColor()</code> method, but the <code>setFilled()</code>
      method does not apply to lines.
    </p>

    <p>
      Work on this program until it produces a display similar to the one in the
      Race program, but feel free to be a little creative. Show your working
      program (complete this far) to the instructor or TA at the beginning of
      lab.
