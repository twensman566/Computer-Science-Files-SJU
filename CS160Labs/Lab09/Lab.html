      Lab 9: Graphical arrays&#8212;bullseyes and bowling pins, revisited
    </h2>

    <h3>
      Part 1: a new <code>BowlingPins</code> class
    </h3>

    <p>
      Using your <code>Bullseye</code> class as a model and the Lab 5
      <code>BowlingPins</code> class for guidance, create a new
      <code>BowlingPins</code> class. There should be two constructors: the first has no parameters
      and calls the second (using <code>this()</code>), passing it
      <code>DEFAULT_NUM_ROWS</code>, which should be defined to be four; the second
      should take one parameter with the number of rows. The size of the array
      should be the total number of pins, which is:
    </p>

    <pre>
      numRows + numRows&#8722;1 + &#8230; + 2 + 1
    = numRows * (numRows + 1) &#8260; 2
    </pre>

    <p>
      You'll want to save the number of rows in an instance variable, but you
      can use the array length if and when you need to check the total number of
      pins
    </p>

    <p>
      Add color changing methods similar to the ones in the
      <code>BoxArray</code> class.
    </p>

    <p>
      Again use the tester from Lab 5 and/or the tester for the
      <code>BoxArray</code> as a model to create a tester for your bowling pins.
      Be sure to test different numbers of rows and different combinations of
      color and fill changes.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Part 2: a Bowling simulator
    </h3>

    <p>
      Write a graphical program that simulates one frame of a bowling game.
      We'll use slightly simplified rules, but you can use the actual rules if
      you prefer. In a typical frame, a bowler gets one or two chances to knock
      down all the pins. If the first throw knocks down all the pins, it's
      called a <em>strike</em>, and the player scores 10 plus the number of pins
      on the next two throws (which will be in the next frame or two if there's
      another strike). If the second throw knocks down all the pins, it's called
      a <em>spare</em>, and the player scores 10 plus the number of pins on the
      next throw (in the next frame). Otherwise, the player scores the number of
      pins knocked over on the two throws of the frame.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your simulation should start with a set of standing bowling pins and an
      array <code>pinsStanding</code> which is initialized to <code>true</code>
      for all the pins; this much can be set up in the <code>init</code> method.
      Use the <code>mouseClicked</code> method to initiate a throw. On each
      throw, generate a number between zero and the number of standing pins,
      inclusive, to represent the number of pins knocked over on this throw; if
      the number of pins knocked over is less than the number of pins still
      standing, randomly select that many of the remaining pins, and mark them
      as eliminated by unfilling them and setting the corresponding value in
      <code>pinsStanding</code> to <code>false</code>; at the end of the throw,
      report the score for the frame so far with a <code>GLabel</code> at the
      top or bottom of the canvas. The frame ends after the first throw if it is
      a strike or else after the second throw. If the frame is a strike, report
      that with the score, and generate a random number between zero and 20 to
      add to the frame's score; if the frame is a spare, report that, and
      generate a random number between zero and 10 to add to the score.
