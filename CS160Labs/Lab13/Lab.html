    <h2>
      Lab 13: Manipulating Text&#8212;Pig Latin
    </h2>

    <p>
      Perhaps you remember trying to speak in “Pig Latin” as a child. Words
      starting with consonants (all of the consonants before the first vowel)
      have the starting consonants removed from the front of a word and added to
      the end of the word followed by “ay” so that, for example, “way” becomes
      “ayway”, “java” becomes “avajay”, “theme” becomes “emethay", and so on.
      Words starting with a vowel stay the same with a “way” appended to their
      end so that “elated” becomes “elatedway”, “after” becomes “afterway” etc.
      In particular, if you had “awesome Pig Latin” it would become “awesomeway
      igPay atinLay”. If you need to refresh your memory more on Pig Latin,
      check out this website:

    <h3>
      Preliminaries
    </h3>

    <p>
      Using a terminal window, copy the directory named <kbd>Lab13</kbd> from
      <kbd>/usr/people/classes/CS160/labs</kbd> into your <kbd>CS160</kbd>
      directory. Use the <kbd>tree</kbd> command to verify that the directory
      structure for your local copy of <kbd>Lab13</kbd> matches the following:
    </p>

    <pre style="color: #d33682;">

    <h3>
      Part 1: A method that translates one word into Pig Latin
    </h3>

    <p>
      You will be completing a program that can take any string of zero or more
      words and convert it to a string of equivalent words in Pig Latin. You
      have been given a complete main program, <code>GraphicsPigLatin</code>
      that provides the user interface for the converter and a
      <code>PigLatin</code> class that contains static methods for converting
      English to Pig Latin. The user interface uses Java GUI components that we
      haven't studied yet, but you won't need to work with those parts of the
      program. The only part you need to complete is the
      <code>convertWord()</code> method in the <code>PigLatin</code> class. The
      rules for how the method should work are in the class comment at the top
      of the file.
    </p>

    <p>
      Show your work to the TA or lab instructor before you go on.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Part 2: Correcting the capitalization
    </h3>

    <p>
      The <code>convertWord()</code> method doesn't work correctly for words
      beginning with a capital consonant. Modify this method so that it handles
      this case correctly; for example, “Pig Latin” will become “Igpay Atinlay”
      instead of “igPay atinLay.” The <code>Character</code> and
      <code>String</code> classes should provide methods appropriate for
      accomplishing this task.
    </p>

    <p>
      Show your work to the TA or lab instructor before you go on.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Part 3: Translating text files into Pig Latin
    </h3>

    <p>
      Write a new <code>Program</code> that opens a <code>Scanner</code> on a
      text file (using a <code>FileChooser</code>), reads and converts each line
      of the file to Pig Latin, and writes each converted line to another file
      using a <code>PrintWriter</code> (also opened with a
      <code>FileChooser</code>.) Use the same methods in the
      <code>PigLatin</code> class for this program.
    </p>

    <p>
      Show your completed program to the TA or lab instructor.
