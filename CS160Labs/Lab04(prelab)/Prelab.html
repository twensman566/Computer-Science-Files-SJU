      Lab 4: Making choices&#8212;doing laundry
    </h2>

    <h3>
      Objectives
    </h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        to learn more about the use of Graphics objects and mouse events
      </li>
      <li>
        to write programs using <code>if</code>-statements and Boolean expressions
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>
      Preliminaries
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      Using a terminal window, copy the directory named Lab04 from
      <code>/usr/people/classes/CS160/labs</code> into your <code>CS160</code>
      directory. Use the <code>ls</code> command to verify that the files
      <code>LaundrySorter.java</code> and <code>RandomColor.java</code> have
      been copied.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      Pre-lab exercise: Drawing randomly-colored lines
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      The file <code>RandomColor.java</code> contains a program that generates
      green lines on the canvas when the user drags the mouse around the canvas.
      Open the file in DrJava. Compile and run the program, comparing the code
      with the way the program works. When you are satisfied that you understand
      how the program does what it does, begin working on modifying the program.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Note: If you get stuck and need to start over, you can make a new copy of
      the original program instead of trying to unwind all the changes you
      made.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You are to modify the program so that instead of drawing only green line,
      the color for each line is selected randomly from red, green, blue, black,
      and yellow. You can do this by using the random number generator as in Lab
      3 to choose a number between 0.0 and 1.0 and then using an
      <code>if</code>-statement to set the color based on the number that was
      generated: 0.0&#8211;0.2 for red, 0.2&#8211;0.4 for green, etc.). This
      selection statement could look something like this:
    </p>
    
    <pre>
    double selection = Math.random();
    if (selection &lt;= 0.2)
    {
      currentColor = Color.RED;
    }
    else if (selection &lt;= 0.4)
    {
      currentColor = Color.GREEN;
    }
    &#8942;</pre>
    
    <p>
      You'll need two more <code>else if</code>-clauses and an
      <code>else</code>-clause
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Test your program to assure yourself that it works correctly. Add
      appropriate comments if you have not already done so. Show your working
      program and code to the lab instructor or TA at the <em>beginning</em> of
      lab.
